API Reference
==============

The package ``pyzernike`` is composed of the following functions, classes, and modules:

- ``pyzernike.radial_polynomial`` alias ``R`` function is used to compute the radial polynomial of a Zernike polynomial.
- ``pyzernike.zernike_polynomial`` alias ``Z`` function is used to compute the Zernike polynomial.
- ``pyzernike.pyramid`` function is used to plot the Zernike polynomials.
